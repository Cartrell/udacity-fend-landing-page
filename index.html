            <h3>How the Poker Hands Section was Built</h3>
            <p>Using the concepts about building the page dynamically, I decided to apply this to
              the "Poker Hands" section.</p>
            <p>Each poker hand is contained within an <code>article</code> element. This element
              specifies two <code>data-*</code> attributes: <code>data-card-ids</code>; and
              <code>data-caption</code>.</p>
            <p>The <code>data-card-ids</code> attribute specifies which cards will be used when
              demonstrating the poker hand. It's a collection of card IDs, where each ID specifies which
              should be created. The format is: <code>cardId1-cardId2-...-cardIdN</code>. Each card ID is
              made up of a card value immediately by card suit. For example, <code>4c</code> represents
              the <em>four of clubs</em>.</p>
            <p>The article element initially contains a paragraph element with a short description, and
              an empty <code>span</code>. The <code>textContent</code> of the <code>span</code> element
              gets updated with values the cards specified by the IDs.</p>
            <p>The code creates an <code>h3</code> header, whose <code>textContent</code> is set to the
              specified caption. The header is inserter <em>before</em> the paragraph element.</p>
            <p>The code also creates <code>figure</code> element, which will contain an <code>img</code>
              for each card in the hand. A <code>figcaption</code> is also created, whose text
              is set to the caption, same as the header. Finally, the <code>figure</code> is appended
              (onto the end) inside the article.</p>
            <p>An example resulting article might look like:
              <pre class="code-block">
  <code class="no-code-format">&lt;article class="poker-hand-container" data-card-ids="ks-as-xs-js-qs" data-caption="Royal Flush"&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Royal Flush&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The highest ranking hand! A Royal Flush consists of five consecutive cards of the same 
    suit, ranking from Ten to Ace: &lt;span&gt;K-A-10-J-Q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class="poker-hand-sample"&gt;
      &lt;img src="./assets/cards/card_ks.png" alt="king of spades" class="poker-hand-sample-card"&gt;
      &lt;img src="./assets/cards/card_as.png" alt="ace of spades" class="poker-hand-sample-card"&gt;
      &lt;img src="./assets/cards/card_xs.png" alt="ten of spades" class="poker-hand-sample-card"&gt;
      &lt;img src="./assets/cards/card_js.png" alt="jack of spades" class="poker-hand-sample-card"&gt;
      &lt;img src="./assets/cards/card_qs.png" alt="queen of spades" class="poker-hand-sample-card"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Royal Flush&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;/article&gt;</code></pre>
            </p>

            <!-- ================================================================================ -->
            <!-- active section details -->
            <!-- ================================================================================ -->
            <h3>How Determining the Active Section was Built</h3>
            <p>This is a modified version of what was proposed in the course content:</p>
            <pre class="code-block">
  <code class="no-code-format">function makeActive() {
    for (const section of sections) {
      const box = section.getBoundingClientRect();
      //Find a value that works best, but 150 seems to be a good start.
      if (box.top <= VALUE && box.bottom >= VALUE) {
        //apply active state on current section and corresponding Nav link
      } else {
        //Remove active state from other section and corresponding Nav link
      }
    }
  }</code></pre>
            <p>However, I decided to make <code>VALUE</code> dependent on the current window height.
            I found using a threshold ratio of <em>15%</em> of the window height to work out
            well.</p>
            <p>So, instead of using a hard value of <code>150</code>, I used something like:</p>
            <pre class="code-block">
  <code class="no-code-format">const VALUE = window.innerHeight * 0.15;</code></pre>
            <p>Hard-coded values (such as the <code>0.15</code>) and other static, design-based
              literals are stored in a global object. This avoids littering the code with
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)" alt="Magic Number"
                target="_blank">magic numbers</a>, and
              its cousin, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_string"
                alt="Magic String" target="_blank">magic strings</a>.</p>

            <!-- ================================================================================ -->
            <!-- auto-hide navbar -->
            <!-- ================================================================================ -->
            <h3>How the Header Nav Bar Auto-Hides</h3>
            <p>This is one of the suggested pieces of functionality.</p>
            <p>When the page first loads, the nav bar is initially visible. It will always remain
              positioned at the top of the view (not scrolling along with the rest of the content).
              The visibility of the nav bar works as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>The nav bar is initially visible.</li>
                <li>If the page has been scrolled so it's no longer at the top, the nav bar will
                  auto-hide under the following conditions:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The mouse pointer is not over any part of the nav bar.</li>
                    <li>A set amount of time has passed after the window is no longer
                      scrolling.</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Each time the page scrolls, the nav bar will reeppar if it was hidden. The
                  countdown timer to auto-hide the nav bar will restart when scrolling has stopped.
                </li>
              </ul></p>
            <p>First, to get the nav bar to remain positioned at the top of the view, the following
              CSS is applied to the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> containing the
              <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>:
                <pre class="code-block">
  <code class="no-code-format">{
    position: sticky;
  }</code></pre></p>
            <p>Using <code>sticky</code> does just that: it causes an element to "stick" to its
              current position, even when the document is scrolling. That's the jist of it, but if
              you're interested, you can learn more about it
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#sticky"
                target="_blank" alt="Sticky Posittion Property">here</a>.</p>
              <a>A caveat is that a sticky element will create its own <em>stacking context</em>.
                This is a three-dimensional coordinate system that determines the order
                in which elemnts drawn on the screen, along the z-axis. Those elements higher on
                the z-axis will appear "in front of" those lower on the z-axis. Most of the time, you
                don't need to worry about this.</a>
              <p>(The z-axis moves away and towards the viewer, similar to how the x-axis moves
                left and right, and the y-axis moves up and down.)</p>
              <p>Using the sticky property causes the page header to appear
                <em>behind</em> the cards. Normally, the header would still appear in front of them,
                because of its own stacking context being created by the sticky positioning.</p>
              <p>However, I'm also applying a <code>transform</code> to each card. Applying a
                transform also causes its element to create <em>its own stacking context</em>. This,
                in turn, causes the cards to appear over the nav bar, which we don't want. We want
                the nav header to always appear in front of everything else.</p>
              <p>To fix this, we add another property to the CSS, the <code>z-index</code>.</p>
              <p>By specifying a z-index higher than <code>0</code>, we can ensure that the page
                header will appear over the other elements:
                <pre class="code-block">
  <code class="no-code-format">{
    position: sticky;
    z-index: 5;
  }</code></pre></p>
              <p><span class="item-header">As aside: </span>A value of <code>5</code> was used instead
                to provide some extra room for expansion, should the situation ever arise.</p>
              <p>I like to think of a stacking context as a building. Each building contains its own
                set of elements, stacked on top of each other.  You can have one or more buildings on
                a page, each with its own rendering order. The buildings themselves are also arranged
                in order, by default, drawn in the order they are created (z-index of auto), unless
                some other property implicitly alters the order.</p>
              <p>In interested, learn more about
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index"
                  alt="z-index CSS property" target="_blank">z-index</a> and
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Understanding_z-index/Stacking_context"
                alt="Stacking Context concept" target="_blank">stacking context</a>.</p>
              <p>As previously stated, the nav bar is initially visible. There are several ways to
                hide the nav bar; I set its <code>top</code> property to a negative value of its
                <code>clientHeight</code> property. This "pushes" it off the top of the screen nd out
                of view. To make it visible again, the top is set to its original value of
                <code>0</code>.
              </p>
              <p>The <code>setTimeout</code> function was used with a specified delay. Once time's
                up, the nav will hide as stated above.</p>
              <p>Because this function is always called each time the window scrolls, you don't want
                many timeouts running. There needs to be a way to <em>cancel</em> the timeout, and
                there should only be one timer running. The <code>setTimeout</code> function returns
                a <em>handle</em> to the timer. You can use this handle to cancel the timer by
                passing it to the <code>clearTimeout</code> function.
              </p>
              <p>It also clears the timeout when the mouse is moved over any portion of the nav bar,
                and restarts it when the mouse moves out of the timer. It listens for the
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointerover_event"
                  alt="pointerover event" target="_blank"><code>pointerover</code></a> and
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointerout_event"
                  alt="pointerout event" target="_blank"><code>pointerout</code></a> events to
                  accomplish this.</p>
              <p>See the following JavaScript:
                <pre class="code-block">
  <code class="no-code-format">function cancelAutoNavHeaderTimeout() {
    // this function will clear the timer if it's active
    if (App.Elements.AutoHideNavHeaderHandle) {
      clearTimeout(App.Elements.AutoHideNavHeaderHandle);
      App.Elements.AutoHideNavHeaderHandle = undefined;
    }
  }</code></pre>

  <pre class="code-block">
  <code class="no-code-format">function hideNavHeaderAfter(delayMs) {
    cancelAutoNavHeaderTimeout();

    // the timer handle is being saved, so the timer can be cleared later if necessary
    App.Elements.AutoHideNavHeaderHandle = setTimeout(() => {
      cancelAutoNavHeaderTimeout();

      if (App.Elements.NavHeader) {
        // this effectively moves the nav bar off the top of the window
        App.Elements.NavHeader.style.top = `-${App.Elements.NavHeader.clientHeight}px`;
      }
    }, delayMs);
  }</code></pre>

    cancelAutoNavHeaderTimeout();

    if (App.Elements.NavHeader) {

  App.Elements.NavHeader.addEventListener('pointerover', () => {
    showBavHeader();
  });

  // once the pointer leaves the nav header, it will auto-hide
  App.Elements.NavHeader.addEventListener('pointerout', () => {
    if (window.scrollY > 0) {
      hideNavHeaderAfter(App.AutoHideNavBarDelayMs);
    }
